# AI_Tutorials
Here are  the labs/example code for my YouTube tutorials on AI development.

As I pusursue my own education in AI, I am constructing a series of youtube tutorials on various AI topics. Many of these videos have a corresponding lab/coding exercise, hosted on this repo. Each folder should correspond to a lesson, and in each folder should be another folder containing the code for you to work from, and the code I wrote as a solution.

Feel free to distribute and modify anything in this repo, so long as you credit its source back to me.
